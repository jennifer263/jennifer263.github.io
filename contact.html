                    <p>As a teacher, I believe it is our job to challenge students in a safe environment.
                        I believe it is our job to challenge students in a safe environment. My role as the
                        teacher will be to asist each child in developing their own potential and learning stlyles.
                        I will create a learning that will incorporate different learning styles. I will
                        incorperate hands-on learning, cooperative learning, projects and individual work
                        that engages students in meaniingful earning. I aspire to bring a positive attitude
                        and high expectations to the classroom each day.<br><br> 
                        Students will participate in large amounts of project based learning. Students will
                        cerate a unit poject for each individual unit based on the priority standard. Project 
                        based learning is a dynamic approach where students actively explore challenges and 
                        problems to gain meaningful learning of a topic.<br><br>Student assessments will be based on 
                        a combination of projects, tests and quizzes to determine mastery of contents and standards. 
                        Each student will have the opportunity to redo any test or project in which they do not achieve 
                        proficiencey. This allows the student to receive feedback and reflect on their learning.<br><br> 
                        I will use student evaluations of both my classroom and content to improve my teaching. I also regularly 
                        participate in professional development workshops to expand my learning. In order to grow as a teacher, 
                        I will apply the knowledge I have gained in Professional Development workshops and through completing my 
                        masters in Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in schools.<br><br><br><br>
                        as well as make the content relevant to the students' lives
