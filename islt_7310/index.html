        <p>Welcome to 8th Grade Social Studies!   This year we will be studying American History from Washingtonâ€™s Presidency to the American Civil War.  While we are learning about the ideas and events that shaped America today, we will also learn the skills for doing research and website credibility.  We will explore different perspectives, our own interpretation of history and how to support those interpretations with evidence.  We will use this website for each unit; the objectives and goals are included in each.  I look forward to an exciting year exploring American History with you!</p>
