        My name is Jennifer Walkup.  I am an 8th grade social studies teacher for Troy School District in Troy, Missouri.  Currently, I teach American History.  Next year will be my seventh year in teaching.  I will be finishing my Masterâ€™s Degree in Information Science and Learning Technology with an emphasis in Technology in Schools in August. I have taken one other web development class.  The class was several years ago.  I definitely need a refresher course.  I hope to create a website for my students to use in American History. I would like to set up the website with each unit for the class as a page on the website.  I love volleyball as both a coach and a player. I coach the 8th grade girls volleyball team.  I also play sand volleyball several times a week.  I like to hike and go camping with my family often.
