        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The goal of the website is to provide information for students and parents.  Students and parents would visit the site for absent work, grades, announcements and class materials.  These resources would provide students and parents with 24 hour access to the classroom.</p>

        <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Students will access the website to find primary sources and questions for the primary sources.</li>
                <li>Parents will access the website to find out when their child’s unit project is due.</li>
                <li>Students will access the website to find links to review materials like Quizlet and Kahoot!</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Design Concept</h2> 
        <h3>Audience</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Male and female.</li>
                <li>Age 13 and parents age average 30 to 40.</li>
                <li>Users live in a suburban/rural district.</li>
                <li>Most users are from a working class background.</li>
                <li>Internet skill are moderate.  Students have iPads issued to them and are adept at using them, but most do not have advanced skills.</li>
            </ul>  

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <a href="./interviews.pdf">Interview Questions with Responses</a>

                
            
        <h3>Reference Websites</h3>
        <p>All five the websites used as a reference were from middle school American History teachers.  Each one used the site for student and parent use.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.bhpanthers.org/Page/877">Mr. Montague&#39;s History Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://wattsah1.weebly.com/">Mr. Watt&#39;s History 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://mrbushistory.blogspot.com/">Mr. Barry&#39;s American History Homepage</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.pcsd.org/domain/403">Ms. Knight&#39;s American History</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://wms.warrensburgr6.org/staff_directory/mrs__stambersky_s_8th_grade_american_history_class">Mrs. Stambersky&#39;s 8th Grade American History Class</a></li>


        </ol>

        <p>The evaluation of each website is numbered the same as the list above.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The school’s information is in the horizontal navigation bar at the top and does allow easy access to district information.  The district and school navigation bar remains at the top when clicking on resources (do not have to use the back button).  The class side navigation bar also remains for the class materials (again the user does not have to use the back button). The teacher has chosen animated cartoons that really do not apply to the subject area and are visually distracting, especially for middle school students who are easily distracted by animation.  The vertical navigation bar on the left has no logical order.  It is not by unit or chronologically ordered (which is usually how American History units are organized). It seems to just be randomly organized.  Information about the colonies may be next to a Cystic Fibrosis Walk link. </li>
            <li>Colors are more subdued (off-white background with black or charcoal grey text).  Picture is of the American Flag and U.S. Constitution (class appropriate).  Horizontal Navigation bar at the top is easy to use.  Home, Homework, Text, Review, More…While the navigation bar is useful and easily understood, most of the material is under the More… tab.  This is not specific and indicates the material is extra. </li>
            <li>Cool pictures in background (Manifest Destiny and Washington Crossing the Delaware) and the colors are subdued to coordinate with the pictures.  Links all work and are relevant.  The website is updated regularly, however, there is no credit given for any of the artwork used.</li>
            <li>Navigation bar at the top is easy to use and stays at top when visiting different parts of the site.  Color scheme and navigation is consistet throughout all the website. There are no pictures on the webpage which may keep students from being distracted, however, students may lose interest.  </li>
            <li>Contact information is readily available.  However, none of the few links work.  The writing is difficult to see in the box with the link.  Very little useful information for parent or student.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Presentation Information</h2>
        <h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
            <p>I intend to present the information for classroom and home use.  A navigation bar at the top for specific information the user is seeking as well as easy contact information and links to the school website and Tyler SIS.</p>
        
        <h3>Text Outline of Website Organization</h3>  
        
        <h4>Homepage</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Title Banner with Mrs. Walkup&#39;s Homepage</li>
                <li>Horizontal Navigation Bar including tabs for Home, Homework, Units, Textbook, and Review</li>
                <li>Course decription and why study history</li>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Any page sources necessary</li>

            </ul>

        <h4>Homework</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Homework assigned with due dates</li>
                <li>Printable worksheets and rubrics</li>

            </ul>

        <h4>Review Material</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Links to material on Quizlet and Kahoot!</li>
                <li>Review packets and study materials</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Textbook</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy or link of online textbook</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Units</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary sources, artwork and any assignments for each unit</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <br>
        <a href="./wireframe.pdf">Wireframe PDF</a>

        <h3>Rational for Organization</h3>
            <p>The navigation bar is clearly labeled.  Each topic will be easy to find.  Each one is a useful topic for students and parents. Each tab on the navigation bar is easy to find and use.  It is clearly labeled and self-evident.  The information is organized so that students can have their learning materials in one place with access 24 hours a day.</p>

        <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>I will use historical pictures and primary source documents from the American Revolution until Reconstruction.  These sources are essential to understanding American History and its people.
                    I intend on using free pictures, art and documents and citing the sources, if necessary in the footer.  Many of the original documents have passed their copyright date and often the reproductions are free for educational use.  I still intend to give credit to those sites when used.</p>

        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>       
                <p>My color choices will be 
                    <span style="color:navy">navy blue</span>,
                    <span style="color:oldlace">off white</span>, and 
                    <span style="color:maroon">maroon</span>.
                      Backgrounds will be light parchment colors.  As an American History teacher the colors and backgrounds are chosen based on vintage American Flags.  I also intend on including pictures of historical artwork.  Usually those colors are more subdued.  Because the website will be used mostly by middle school students, I intend to limit the bright colors (more for elementary students) and animations to limit distractions. I want parents to also be able to find information quickly and easily.</p>
